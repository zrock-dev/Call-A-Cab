# Call-A-Cab System

## Description
- The Call-A-Cab System provides a console interface for the user to interact, allowing they to book either one or more cabs for various trips.
- This project uses a DBMS to store and manage its data, that's because of the large query combinations we can use.

## Application execution requirements
- Before running *please* in your mySQL server run the [Initialize_DB.sql](assets/Database_configuration/Initialize_DB.sql) file located in the directory [Database_configuration](assets/Database_configuration)
- Now *please* in the [DataBase](src/Model/DataBase.java) class, update the `loginUser()` method with your user login information.
- And you are good to go.
